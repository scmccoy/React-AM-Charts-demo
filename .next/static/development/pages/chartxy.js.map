values\r\n * from a [[DataItem]].\r\n *\r\n * To activate such binding, set element's `dataItem` property.\r\n *\r\n * When activated, text contents will be parsed for special tags, e.g.:\r\n *\r\n * ```TypeScript\r\n * label.dataItem = myDataItem;\r\n * label.text = \"The title is: {title}\";\r\n * ```\r\n * ```JavaScript\r\n * label.dataItem = myDataItem;\r\n * label.text = \"The title is: {title}\";\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * The above will automatically replace \"{title}\" in the string with the\r\n * actual data value from `myDataItem`.\r\n *\r\n * Note, that most often dataItem is set by the Component.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link ILabelEvents} for a list of available events\r\n * @see {@link ILabelAdapters} for a list of available Adapters\r\n * @see {@link

*\r\n * Locale: en\r\n * Language: International English\r\n * Author: Martynas Majeris\r\n *\r\n * Follow instructions in [on this page](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/tutorials/creating-translations/) to make corrections or add new translations.\r\n *\r\n * ---\r\n * Edit but leave the header section above this line. You can remove any\r\n * subsequent comment sections.\r\n * ---\r\n *\r\n * Use this file as a template to create translations. Leave the key part in\r\n * English intact. Fill the value with a translation.\r\n *\r\n * Empty string means no translation, so default \"International English\"\r\n * will be used.\r\n *\r\n * If you need the translation to literally be an empty string, use `null`\r\n * instead.\r\n *\r\n * IMPORTANT:\r\n * When translating make good effort to keep the translation length\r\n * at least the same chartcount as the English, especially for short prompts.\r\n *\r\n * Having significantly longer prompts may distort the actual charts.\r\n *\r\n * NOTE:\r\n * Some prompts - like months or weekdays - come in two versions: full and\r\n * shortened.\r\n *\r\n * If there's no official shortened version of these in your language, and it\r\n * would not be possible to invent such short versions that don't seem weird\r\n * to native speakers of that language, fill those with the same as full\r\n * version.\r\n *\r\n * PLACEHOLDERS:\r\n * Some prompts have placeholders like \"%1\". Those will be replaced by actual\r\n * values during translation and should be retained in the translated prompts.\r\n *\r\n * Placeholder positions may be changed to better suit structure of the\r\n * sentence.\r\n *\r\n * For example \"From %1 to %2\", when actually used will replace \"%1\" with an\r\n * actual value representing range start, and \"%2\" will be replaced by end\r\n * value.\r\n *\r\n * E.g. in a Scrollbar for Value axis \"From %1 to %2\" will become\r\n * \"From 100 to 200\". You may translate \"From\" and \"to\", as well as re-arrange\r\n * the order of the prompt itself, but make sure the \"%1\" and \"%2\" remain, in\r\n * places where they will make sense.\r\n *\r\n * Save the file as language_LOCALE, i.e. `en_GB.ts`, `fr_FR.ts`, etc.\r\n */\r\nexport default {\r\n    // Number formatting options.\r\n    // \r\n    // Please check with the local standards which separator is accepted to be\r\n    // used for separating decimals, and which for thousands.\r\n    \"_decimalSeparator\": \".\",\r\n    \"_thousandSeparator\": \",\",\r\n    // Suffixes for numbers\r\n    // When formatting numbers, big or small numers might be reformatted to\r\n    // shorter version, by applying a suffix.\r\n    // \r\n    // For example, 1000000 might become \"1m\".\r\n    // Or 1024 might become \"1KB\" if we're formatting byte numbers.\r\n    // \r\n    // This section defines such suffixes for all such cases.\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_3\": \"k\",\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_6\": \"M\",\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_9\": \"G\",\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_12\": \"T\",\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_15\": \"P\",\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_18\": \"E\",\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_21\": \"Z\",\r\n    \"_big_number_suffix_24\": \"Y\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_3\": \"m\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_6\": \"μ\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_9\": \"n\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_12\": \"p\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_15\": \"f\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_18\": \"a\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_21\": \"z\",\r\n    \"_small_number_suffix_24\": \"y\",\r\n    \"_byte_suffix_B\": \"B\",\r\n    \"_byte_suffix_KB\": \"KB\",\r\n    \"_byte_suffix_MB\": \"MB\",\r\n    \"_byte_suffix_GB\": \"GB\",\r\n    \"_byte_suffix_TB\": \"TB\",\r\n    \"_byte_suffix_PB\": \"PB\",\r\n    // Default date formats for various periods.\r\n    // \r\n    // This should reflect official or de facto formatting universally accepted\r\n    // in the country translation is being made for\r\n    // Available format codes here:\r\n    // https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/concepts/formatters/formatting-date-time/#Format_codes\r\n    // \r\n    // This will be used when formatting date/time for particular granularity,\r\n    // e.g. \"_date_hour\" will be shown whenever we need to show time as hours.\r\n    \"_date_millisecond\": \"mm:ss SSS\",\r\n    \"_date_second\": \"HH:mm:ss\",\r\n    \"_date_minute\": \"HH:mm\",\r\n    \"_date_hour\": \"HH:mm\",\r\n    \"_date_day\": \"MMM dd\",\r\n    \"_date_week\": \"ww\",\r\n    \"_date_month\": \"MMM\",\r\n    \"_date_year\": \"yyyy\",\r\n    // Default duration formats for various base units.\r\n    // \r\n    // This will be used by DurationFormatter to format numeric values into\r\n    // duration.\r\n    // \r\n    // Notice how each duration unit comes in several versions.
